h1. Ruby On Acid

A Ruby library for making trippy visuals.


h1. Factories

The factory is the core concept of Ruby On Acid.  You create a factory of a particular type, and then anywhere in your code that you need a value within a certain range, you get it from the factory.  For example, if you need x and y coordinates for drawing on a 800 x 600 window, you would tell a factory that you need a value for :x from 0 to 800, and a value for :y from 0 to 600.  If you later wanted to change drawing patterns, you could simply swap out factories.


h1. Roadmap

* A factory that evaluates the last value for 2 keys and modifies a third based on them.  (Example, change the size of rectangles based on their x and y coordinates.
* Skip Factory: Add probability matrix [0.5, 0.9, 0.1...] that causes get_unit() to return true every time rand() is > given value. Also add mask value (0.1, 0.9), etc, that is added to random value to increase likelihood of returning true.
